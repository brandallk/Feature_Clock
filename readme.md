### Animated clock

This small app uses JavaScript to animate a clock illustration made in Adobe
Illustrator and saved as SVG. It was created as a feature that will fit into a
larger project I'm working on.

The clock can be run in either forward or reverse direction, at either normal
speed (1 "tick" per second) or fast speed (4 "ticks" per second).
